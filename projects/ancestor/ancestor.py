For example, in this diagram and the sample input,
3 is a child of 1 and 2, and 5 is a child of 4:

 10
 /
1   2   4  11
 \ /   / \ /
  3   5   8
   \ / \   \
    6   7   9

Write a function that, given the dataset and the ID 
of an individual in the dataset, returns their earliest 
known ancestor â€“ the one at the farthest distance from the 
input individual. If there is more than one ancestor tied 
for "earliest", return the one with the lowest numeric ID. 
If the input individual has no parents, the function should 
return -1.

Example input

  2 3
  3 6
  5 6
  5 7
  4 5
